GraphQL and React are extemely popular web development platforms that are highly desired by developers and employers alike. But learning how to use them can be challenging if you're not practicing them in context.

Hey there, this is Ray Villalobos, Senior Staff Instructor at LinkedIn. In this course, I'm going to show you how to create a realistic application that uses Github's GraphQL API to show you a searchable list of the respositories on your account.

We'll go step by step through the concepts and then dive into building the application using the latest React techniques, which include React Hooks, authenticating into Github Graphql, paginating and searching through GraphQL data.

This is a hands-on course for those who like learning by building. So if you're ready to get busy with React and GraphQL, let's get started.
