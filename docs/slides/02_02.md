# GraphQL Queries

- Schema
- Fields
- Types

> >

Let's talk about the structure of a the GraphQL query we just ran. 

The structure of all your data is known as the `schema`

Searches are done by using looking through different `fields` and sub-fields. So, in our example, query is a field we're looking for.

The fields can be of different types. You're probably familiar with some traditional types like strings, integers and booleans, but each GraphQL instance also has it's own custom types.

# GraphQL Requests

- Queries
- Mutations

> >

In the Github GraphQL API, there are two root types you can use.

The first is `queries`. This is a simple request for information from the server. The query type has a number of sub-fields you can request. In our example, we asked for the viewer, but you can also ask for information about organizations,  repos or users.

The second is a mutation. This creates a request to modify data on the Github servers.

# Adding other Fields

```
{
  viewer {
    login
    name
    bio
    company
    avatarUrl
  }
}

```

> >

You can request more than one field, so let's add `name`, `bio`, `company` and `avatarUrl`

In the explorer, there are pop-up hints that appear as you type in the editor. It will show up if you type a letter, or you can use `ctrl-m` to make he hints appear at any time. 

Notes: It doesn't matter what order things are in, by the way and you can add a comment using a pound sign.

## Arguments

> >

You can pass arguments to repositories, so let's say I wanted information about a specific license you can use in repos.

Let's use the docs to read how we would do this. Click on the Query field and scroll down to the license field. Note that it expects an argument called key and then a string. Now click on the license type to see details.

Notice that it expects a [SPDX ID](https://spdx.org/licenses/), which are shortnames for all of the difference licenses.

Because it has an `!` mark, I know that this is a required field. And notice that afterwards it explains that this item returns a License.

I happen to know that the SPXID for the MIT license is just the word `MIT`, so let's try sending that.

This type will also want to know which fields we want to ask for. If you click on the license type, you'll see that there are lots of other things we can ask for like the name, description,body, etc.

```
{
  license(key: "MIT") {
    name
    description
    body
    url
  }
}
```

Now take a peek at the explorer and you'll notice that you can also choose things from there, or see the structure of the fields. Somtimes it helps to see then in that outline format.

# Authorizing with GraphQL

In order to work with the Github GraphQL Application Programming Interface (API), we'll need to create an Authentication Token. It's a secret that will give an application access.

Before you do this make sure you're logged in and that your email has been verified.

1. Go to the top right of the page and click on your account's icon.

![Account Settings](http://pixelprowess.com/i/2021-01-12_01-36-31.png)

2. Go to `Developer Settings` on the left menu
3. Click on `Personal Access Tokens`
4. Click on `Generate New Token`
5. Under Note add a label 
6. Check the appropriate permissions

The permissions will give the application that you're trying to run access to the repo and you can control how much access you give my modifying these permissions.

```
[x] repo
[ ] admin:org
  [x] read:org
[ ] admin:repo_hook
  [x] read:repo_hook
[x] user
[ ] admin:gpg_key
  [x] read:pgp_key
```

Once you do that, you'll see a personal access token. You can click on the icon to copy this to the clipboard. As it says, this is the only time you'll see this token so make sure you save it in a safe place.

## Entrypoint

When you need to receive some data, you can use the link to this endpoint: https://api.github.com/graphql

and pass along the query.
